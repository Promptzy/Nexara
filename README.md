## 🚀 Project Overview

Zenjira is like a personal AI assistant for Jira teams. It helps save time and reduce manual work by offering:

- **No-code automation** using n8n (just drag and drop rules!)
- **AI features** like ticket summarization and sprint planning with GPT‑4
- **Live dashboards** and visual tools like Gantt charts
- **Deep integrations** with GitHub/GitLab, Slack, CI/CD tools, and more

It’s built as a full **web application** — not just a browser extension — meaning teams log into Zenjira just like any other SaaS platform to get started.

---

## ✨ Features

### Core Features

- **Automation Designer**: Use n8n's drag-and-drop editor to automate Jira events like task transitions or sending Slack notifications.
- **AI Sprint Planner**: GPT‑4 helps generate sprints based on team capacity and priorities.
- **Smart Ticket Summaries**: Instantly summarize long issue descriptions with AI.
- **ChatOps Bot**: Use Slack or Microsoft Teams to ask things like "What are today's blockers?"
- **Developer Load Balancer**: Distribute tasks more evenly to avoid burnout.

### Advanced Features

- **Semantic Search**: Use Hugging Face models to search Jira issues based on meaning, not just keywords.
- **AI Test Case Generator**: Turn bug reports into suggested test cases.
- **Retrospective Insights**: Get reports on what worked and what didn’t after every sprint.
- **Gantt and Calendar Views**: Visual tools to see due dates, timelines, and sprint plans.
- **Cross-Project Heatmap**: Identify bottlenecks and dependencies between multiple projects.
- **Auto Release Notes**: Generate release notes from closed issues and merged pull requests.
